# Kaggle-Projects

This repo is Active - I keep adding my kaggle projects here.

### 1. BBC Text News Classifciation:

We will use the BBC headline news text, labeled across 5 categories, i.e., 'Tech', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Entertainment', and 'Politics', and train our model with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

Finally we will try using some random out of the dataset headlines to test whether our model correctly classifies them into respective label class.
